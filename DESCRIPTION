Description: This is a generic plotting package meant to provide an easy way 
    for bioinformaticists and clinicians to visualize pharmacogenomic data. The 
    package provides some of the most commonly used graphs for visualizing drug 
    response data: waterfall plots, volcano plots, and Manhattan plots. A 
    forest plotting function is available for visualizing metadata.
    These graphs are intended to help clinicians spot promising biomarkers. To 
    further analyze biomarker genes, this package additionally provides some 
    gene set analyis functions. These functions (wrapped in the geneSetAnalysis 
    pipeline) allow clinicians to find all gene sets that a query gene belongs 
    to, and then evaluate overlap in those gene sets. The gene sets that a 
    query gene is found in are mapped on a network plot, to help visualize the 
    most notable biological roles of a gene. This gene set analysis puts 
    biomarkers into their biological context, which can help clinicians 
    understand why some genes are more responsive to certain compounds than 
    others, etc.
