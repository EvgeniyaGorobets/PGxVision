Objective: PGxVision is an R package for visualizing and interpreting 
preclinical pharmacogenomic data. It provides functions for plotting the drug 
responses of cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts and it lets 
users see which genes are correlated with significant drug sensitivity or 
resistance.

Audience: It is intended to help clinicians, physicians, and other 
specialists identify RNA-based biomarkers and then use those biomarkers to
predict how cancer patients will react to certain therapeutic treatments.

Uniqueness: PGxVision is unique because it lets users perform a gene set 
analysis on biomarkers that they identify in the drug sensitivity plots. 
Users can retrieve all the biological pathways that a gene is in and 
build a network plot showing the overlap of the pathways. This  
provides clinicians with biological context for the biomarkers, so that they 
can better reason about the effectiveness of certain treatments over others.
